This project simulates the classical cart pole balancing problem. Normally PID gains can be calculated or reinforcement learning can be applied directly
As a different approach to explore optimizaztion algorithms , genetic algorithm has been applied to calulate the PID gains and results are simulated in Gazebo and ROS.
The code can be further improved by improvising the mutation logic, crossover etc or by hit and trial to calculate optimal population , number of generations etc.
The following video and terminal output shows a glimpse of the working of Genetic Algorithm as the cart pole learns and tries to improve its stability. The output on terminal shows the values of gains obtained.
